# ERPL-Bot
The bot that will do all things for the ERPL Discord that we want done.

### Member Discord Dues Tracking
We have a google sheet with all members who paid dues, first and last. We have a discord with members joining. 
This bot will update a person's role in the discord server when they change their name to a name in the list (First last) then mark their name as taken on the spreadsheet.

### Further Discord Features:
- [ ] On user join, send intro message. (explain rolling)
- [ ] Automation of group roles by messaging to the bot (member wants to joing cardea chat, gets cardea role)
- [ ] Add DECtalk tts (*John Madden*)
